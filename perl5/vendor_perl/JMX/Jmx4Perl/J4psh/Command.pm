=head1 NAME 

JMX::Jmx4Perl::J4psh::Command - Base object for commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base command from which all j4psh commands should be extended.  It
provides registration hooks so that the command handler can determine the
position of this command in the menu structure. Additionally it provides common
methods useful for each command to perform its action.

A L<JMX::Jmx4Perl::J4psh::Command> is a collection of shell commands, grouped in a
certain context. It can be reused in different contexts and hence can occur at
different places in the menu structure.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $command_handler = new JMX::Jmx4Perl::Command($context)

Constructor, which should not called be directly on this module but on a
submodule. In fact, it will be called (indirectly) only by the
L<JMX::Jmx4Perl::J4psh::CommandHandler> during the command registration process. 
The single argument required is the central context object. 

=cut 

sub new { 
    my $class = shift;
    my $context = shift;
    my $self = ref($_[0]) eq "HASH" ? $_[0] : {  @_ };
    bless $self,(ref($class) || $class);
    $self->{context} = $context;
    return $self;
}

=item $global_commands = $cmd->global_commands

This method is called by the command handler during registration in order to
obtain the global commands which are always present in the menu. The default
implementation returns C<undef> which means that no global commands should be
registered. Overwrite this to provide a command hashref as known to
L<Term::ShellUI> for setting the global commands. 

=cut

sub global_commands { 
    return undef;
}

=item $top_commands = $cmd->top_commands

This method is called by the command handler during registration in order to
obtain the top commands which are present in the top level menu. The default
implementation returns C<undef> which means that no top commands are to be
registered. Overwrite this to provide a command hashref as known to
L<Term::ShellUI> for setting the top commands. 

=cut

sub top_commands { 
    return undef;
}

=item $context = $cmd->context

Get the context object used during construction. This is a convenience method
for sublassed commands.

=cut

sub context {
    return shift->{context};
}

=item $complete_handler = $cmd->complete

Convenience method to get the L<JMX::Jmx4perl::J4psh::CompletionHandler> for getting
various command line completions.

=cut

sub complete {
    return shift->{context}->complete;
}

=item $agent = $cmd->agent

Convenience method to get the L<JMX::Jmx4Perl> agent in order to 
contact the server agent bundle (via L<JMX::Jmx4Perl>)

=cut

sub agent {
    return shift->{context}->agent;
}

=item @colors = $cmd->color(@color_ids) 

Return a list of ANSI color strings for the given symbolic color names which
are looked up from the current color theme. If no coloring is enabled, empty
strings are returned. This method dispatched directly to the underylying
C<context> object.

=cut 

sub color {
    return shift->{context}->color(@_);
}

=item $cmd->push_on_stack("context",$cmds) 

Rerturn a sub (closure) which can be used as a command to update the context
stack managed by the command handler. Update in this sense means push the given
context ("C<context>") on the stack, remembering the provided shell commands
C<$cmds> for later use when traversing the stack upwards via C<..>

=cut 

sub push_on_stack {
    my $self = shift;
    my @args = @_;
    return sub {
        $self->{context}->{commands}->push_on_stack(@args);
    };
}

=item $cmd->pop_off_stack 

Go up one level in the stack

=cut

sub pop_off_stack {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{context}->{commands}->pop_off_stack();
}

=item $cmd->reset_stack

Reset the stack completely effectively jumping on top of it

=cut

sub reset_stack {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{context}->{commands}->reset_stack();
}

=item ($opts,@args) = $cmd->extract_command_options($spec,@args);


Extract any options from a command specified via C<$spec>. This method uses
L<Getopt::Long> for extrating the options. It returns a hashref with the
extracted options and an array of remaining arguments

=cut 

sub extract_command_options {
    my ($self,$spec,@args) = @_;
    my $opts = {};
    {
       local @ARGV = @args;
       GetOptions($opts,@{$spec});
       @args = @ARGV;
    }
    return ($opts,@args);
}

=item $label = $cmd->format_date($time)

Formats a date like for C<ls -l>:

 Dec  2 18:21
 Jun 23  2009

This format is especially useful when used in listing.

=cut 

sub format_date {
    my $self = shift;
    my $time = shift;
    if (time - $time > 60*60*24*365) {
        return strftime "%b %d %Y",localtime($time);
    } else {
        return strftime "%b %d %H:%M",localtime($time);
    }
}

=item $cmd->print_paged($txt,$nr_lines)

Use a pager for printing C<$txt> which has C<$nr_lines> lines. Only if
C<$nr_lines> exceeds a certain limit (default: 24), then the pager is used,
otherwise C<$txt> is printed directly.

=cut 

sub print_paged {
    my $self = shift;
    my $text = shift;
    my $nr = shift;
    if (!$nr) {
        $nr = scalar(split /\n/s,$text);
    }
    my $max_rows = $self->context->term_height;
    if (defined($nr) && $nr < $max_rows) {
        print $text;
    } else {
        view("",$text);
    }
}

=item $trimmed = $cmd->trim_string($string,$max)

Trim a string C<$string> to a certain length C<$max>, i.e. if C<$string> is
larger than C<$max>, then it is truncated to to C<$max-3> and C<...> is
appended. If it is less or equal, than C<$string> is returned unchanged. 

=cut 

sub trim_string {
    my $self = shift;
    my $string = shift;
    my $max = shift;
    return length($string) > $max ? substr($string,0,$max-3) . "..." : $string;
}

=item $converted = $cmd->convert_wildcard_pattern_to_regexp($orig)

Convert the wildcards C<*> and C<.> to their regexp equivalent and return a
regular expression.

=cut 

sub convert_wildcard_pattern_to_regexp {
    my $self = shift;
    my $wildcard = shift;
    $wildcard =~ s/\?/./g;
    $wildcard =~ s/\*/.*/g;
    return qr/^$wildcard$/i;
}
